# JDACommander
A flexible command library for use with JDA (Java Discord API). I'll do a readme later.

# Installation

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/techdweebgaming/JDACommander/JDACommander/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/techdweebgaming/JDACommander/JDACommander/_latestVersion)

Add the following to your dependencies section in build.gradle. Make sure to replace version with the latest version, shown above. You'll also need to add jcenter to your repositories section, if it's not already there.
```gradle
  repositories {
    jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.techdweebgaming:jdacommander:version'
  }
```
